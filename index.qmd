## Your Role as a Communication Liaison

As a **Communication Liaison**, you bridge the gap between:

- **Data Scientists** who understand the numbers
- **Creative Teams** who understand the audience  
- **Project Stakeholders** who understand the goals

Your job is to **translate**, **facilitate**, and **document**—turning complex insights into clear action.
