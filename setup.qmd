Your vault is organized into six folders:

| **01_Journal** | Weekly reflections | Sample journal entries showing the three thinking paths (Connector, Troubleshooter, Critic) |
| **02_Literature** | Reading notes & course materials | Includes textbook chapters and citation templates |
| **03_Project** | Active research work | Organized by prospectus, codebook, data, and drafts folders |
| **04_Resources** | Media & attachments | Images, PDFs, external files, and course materials |
| **99_Templates** | Reusable templates | Weekly journal template and data dictionary template to copy and customize |

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I extracted the ZIP file but Obsidian won't open it as a vault**
- Make sure you're opening the folder that contains the `.obsidian` hidden folder
- Try right-clicking the folder and checking "Show hidden files" if needed

**Q: Where do I put my weekly journal entries?**
- Create a new file in `01_Journal` named something like `Week_01_MyName.md`
- Copy the template from `99_Templates/Weekly_Journal_Template.md` and fill it out

**Q: Can I share my vault with classmates?**
- Yes! You can email them the ZIP file, or sync it via Git/GitHub for collaborative projects
