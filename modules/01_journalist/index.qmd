## Phase I Overview

In this phase, you'll develop the habits of a research journalist: reading critically, reflecting thoughtfully, and documenting consistently. Each week, you'll engage with a chapter from the [Vibes to Variables textbook](https://sim-lab-siue.github.io/vibes-to-variables/) and write a 250-300 word reflection.

### The Journalist Mindset
- **Read actively**: Engage with the text, ask questions, make connections
- **Reflect deeply**: Consider how concepts apply to your interests
- **Document consistently**: Build your personal knowledge archive
- **Share openly**: Contribute to collaborative learning through GitHub

## Weekly Schedule

| Week | Chapter | Key Topics |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Week 1** | Ch 1: The Science of Storytelling | Introduction to research methods |
| **Week 2** | Ch 2: The Publishing Engine | Research publication process |
| **Week 3** | Ch 3: The Scientific Approach | Scientific method fundamentals |
| **Week 4** | Ch 4: Intelligence Gathering | Literature review and sources |

Follow the [Setup Guide](../../setup.qmd) to:
1. Download your `Liaison_Vault.zip` from the [Resources page](../../resources/index.qmd)
2. Extract it to your Documents folder
3. Install and configure Obsidian
4. Connect your vault to Obsidian
5. Configure attachment settings

**Due:** Before your first class meeting

### Activity 2: Explore Your Vault Structure (15 minutes)

Open your Liaison_Vault and review each folder:

| Folder | Purpose | What You'll Do |
|--------|---------|---|
| **00_Inbox** | Quick capture | Write daily thoughts & ideas here first |
| **01_Journal** | Weekly reflections | Use templates to reflect each week |
| **02_Literature** | Research notes | Organize all your reading notes |
| **03_Project** | Active research | Organize by prospectus, codebook, data, drafts |
| **04_Resources** | Media & attachments | Store images, PDFs, external files |
| **99_Templates** | Reusable templates | Copy templates to start new work |

### Activity 3: Your First Journal Entry (10-15 minutes)

Create a new file in `01_Journal/` named `Week_01_Reflection.md`

Use one of the three thinking paths:

1. **The Connector** - How does being a liaison relate to things you already know?
2. **The Troubleshooter** - What challenges might you face in this role?
3. **The Critic** - Does the liaison role resonate with your experience?

Write 3-5 sentences. No pressure—just think on paper. 📝
