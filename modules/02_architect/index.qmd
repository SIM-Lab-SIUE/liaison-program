# Phase II: The Architect

**Duration:** Weeks 2-4 (Jan 19 - Feb 02) | **Points:** 125  
Design your digital workspace and research foundation
:::

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Phase II, you will:

:::{.learning-objectives}
- ✅ Build a professional GitHub profile
- ✅ Confirm software installation (R, RStudio, Obsidian, Quarto)
- ✅ Structure your digital office for research
- ✅ Identify and evaluate media archives
- ✅ Understand data source feasibility
:::

---

## Phase II Overview

As an architect designs blueprints before construction, you'll design your research infrastructure. This phase ensures your digital workspace is properly configured and you understand where to find data for your research.

### The Architect Mindset
- **Plan ahead**: Set up systems before you need them
- **Build foundations**: Establish reliable workflows
- **Choose materials**: Select appropriate data sources
- **Document structure**: Create clear organizational systems

---

## Assignments

### GitHub Profile (25 points)
**Due:** Week 1 (Jan 12)

Create a public GitHub profile with:
- Professional photo
- README.md introducing yourself

## What You'll Do

In Phase 2, you'll move from understanding the liaison role to asking **good questions**:

**Frame Research Questions** — Move from vague ideas to clear, testable questions with defined variables

**Map Stakeholders & Sources** — Understand who needs what information and where data lives

**Plan Data Collection** — Design ethical approaches (surveys, interviews, data scraping, observations)

**Identify Risks** — Consider privacy, bias, sampling, and other potential challenges

---

## Phase 2 Assignments & Activities

### ⭐ FIRST: Complete the Week 03 Project Setup Assignment

Before diving into research activities, ensure your vault is organized and ready for data.

[→ Go to Week 03: Project Setup Assignment](week-03-project-setup.qmd){.btn .btn-primary}

This assignment takes **10-15 minutes** and is worth **25 points**.

---

## Phase 2 Content & Activities

### Activity 1: Understanding Good Research Questions (Week 3-4)

Work through these steps:

1. **Read & Compare** - Review 2-3 example research questions from your field
2. **Critique** - What makes them clear or vague? What variables are defined?
3. **Rewrite** - Take a vague question and rewrite it with clear variables

**Example:**
- ❌ *Vague:* "How do people use social media?"
- ✅ *Clear:* "What communication patterns distinguish active vs. passive users on TikTok among ages 18-25?"

**Submit:** Your rewritten research questions (2-3 examples) in `03_Project/01_Prospectus/`

### Activity 2: Stakeholder & Data Source Mapping (Week 4)

Create a one-page visual map showing:

- **Who cares?** - Primary stakeholders (who needs your findings?)
- **What's available?** - Existing data sources (surveys, databases, interviews, archives)
- **What's missing?** - Gaps in current data
- **How will you collect?** - Your planned methods

**Submit:** A visual map (diagram, table, or infographic) in `03_Project/01_Prospectus/`

### Activity 3: Mini Research Proposal (Week 5)

Write a 2-3 page mini proposal including:

1. **Problem Statement** - Why does this question matter?
2. **Research Questions** - What specifically will you investigate?
3. **Methods Overview** - How will you collect data?
4. **Timeline** - When will each step happen?
5. **Risks & Mitigations** - What could go wrong and how will you address it?

**Submit:** `03_Project/01_Prospectus/Mini_Proposal.md`

## Key Concepts: The Research Mindset

### Variables (The Building Blocks)

**Independent Variable** - What you *control* or *predict from*  
**Dependent Variable** - What you *measure* or *predict to*  
**Control Variables** - What you *hold constant*

### Research Designs

- **Exploratory** - What's happening? (descriptive)
- **Explanatory** - Why is it happening? (causal)
- **Evaluative** - Is it working? (assessment)

### Ethical Considerations

- **Informed Consent** - Did people agree to participate?
- **Privacy & Confidentiality** - How will you protect personal data?
- **Fairness & Bias** - Are your methods equitable?
- **Harm Reduction** - Could participation cause distress?
